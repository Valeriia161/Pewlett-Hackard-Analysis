# ` Pewlett Hackard Challenge`


 ## `Project Overview ` <br/>
 
•	Deliverable 1: The Number of Retiring Employees by Title. <br/>
•	Deliverable 2: The Employees Eligible for the Mentorship Program. <br/>
•	Deliverable 3: A written report on the employee database analysis (README.md). <br/>

In this analysis, I determined the number of retiring employees per title, and identified employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. Finally, I submitted a written report that summarized my analysis and helped prepare Bobby’s manager for the “silver tsunami” as many current employees reach retirement age.


#### Resources <br/>
•	Data Source: [Google]( Google), <br/>
•	Software: Python 3.6.1, Jupyter, Git Bash, pgAdmin4, SQL.


## `Summary`


 The number of retiring employees grouped by title. <br/>
•	The table includes employees’ titles and their sum. <br/>
•	The query returns a cohesive table with 7 rows. <br/>
•	From this table we can quickly see how many employees with certain title will retire in the next few years.
