# ` Pewlett Hackard Challenge`


 ## `Project Overview ` <br/>
 
•	Deliverable 1: The Number of Retiring Employees by Title. <br/>
•	Deliverable 2: The Employees Eligible for the Mentorship Program. <br/>
•	Deliverable 3: A written report on the employee database analysis (README.md). <br/>

In this analysis, I determined the number of retiring employees per title, and identified employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. Finally, I submitted a written report that summarized my analysis and helped prepare Bobby’s manager for the “silver tsunami” as many current employees reach retirement age.


#### Resources <br/>
•	Data Source: [Google]( Google), <br/>
•	Software: Git Bash, pgAdmin4, SQL.


## `Results`


 ##### The number of retiring employees grouped by title. <br/>
•	The table includes employees’ titles and their sum. <br/>
•	The query returns a cohesive table with 7 rows. <br/>
•	From this table we can quickly see how many employees with certain title will retire in the next few years.

## `Summary`


###### Pewlett Hackard Analysis helps to provide high-level responses to the following questions: <br/>
o	How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact? <br/>
There are 7 job titles that will be impacted and will need to be filled: Senior Engineer, Senior Staff, Engineer, Staff, Technique Leader, Assistant Engineer, Manager. <br/>
o	Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees? <br/>
There are 133,776 people retiring and only 1,549 mentors. If the company doesn’t have quick reference materials or simple how-to guides that new hires can reference there will be a large learning/training gap.
